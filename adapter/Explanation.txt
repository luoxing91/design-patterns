Adapter pattern allow to convert one class interface to another. 
Adatepter let you add existing class new inteface which better 
fits to existing code.


You should always use this appropach when you use in your code
external class or library. Because you would be able easy switch
to another library (e.g new version, different faster) by doing 
changes only in one class not in whole system.
