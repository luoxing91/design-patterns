Abstract factory gives client interface to create families (more then one family). 
(releted or depenedent on each other) of objects without 
force him (client) to use real class names (e.g. new className)
in fact client don't know whitch class (implementation) he 
realy using - he only use abstraction (interface).

The maim diffrence between abstract factory and factory method
is that Factory method produce one family of object while 
abstract factory produce families of objects  
(abstract factory is often implemented as few factory methods ).
Another diffrence is in intend of using the abstraction 
(interface). Factory method use abstraction only to postpone
creation concreate objects to subclass - to create object
you have to extends base class and overriate factory method.
Abstract factory uses abstraction also to separete client
code from diffrent implementation of factory - you create
concreate factory implementation and pass it to the code
which use abstract factory interface.
