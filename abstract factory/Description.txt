Abstract factory let client create objects of more than one family 
(releted or depenedent on each other) without force him (client)
to use real class names. This is posible by (Abstract Factory) 
interface whose implementation - factory object client use to 
produce needed set of objects (each method of factory produce one family)  

The maim diffrence between abstract factory and factory method
is that Factory method only separete client from concrete type
of objects. Abstract factory separete also client from different
implementation of factory - client create concreate factory
implementation and pass it to the code which use abstract factory 
interface to produce objects.

Example of injection code by using composition.
