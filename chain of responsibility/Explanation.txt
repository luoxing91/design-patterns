Chain of responsibility helps to separate sender of a request and receiver 
of the request by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.
(Sender don't know which object in the chain will handle its request)
Reqest is sent to an object and if that object can't handle it, it
sends it to another object in chain that may be able to handle it.
Objective version of switch statement.
