Bridge design patter allows you to separate class interface (abstraction)
from its implementation so you can easy change both independently.

The UML class diagram for the Strategy pattern is the same as the diagram 
for the Bridge pattern. However, these two design patterns aren't the same
in their intent. Strategy pattern is meant for behavior, while Bridge is 
meant for structure.
While strategy is use to exchange algorithm at runtime.
Bridge pattern deals with the structural aspects by providing a mechanism 
to avoid creating n number of classes. e.g

                   ----Shape---
                  /            \
         Rectangle              Circle
        /         \            /      \
BlueRectangle  RedRectangle BlueCircle RedCircle


Refactor to:


          ----Shape---                        Color
         /            \                       /   \
Rectangle(Color)   Circle(Color)           Blue   Red
